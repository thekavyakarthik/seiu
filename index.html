                From a young age, my parents, both who were active in the civil rights movement, taught me the importance of rights and freedom 
                for all people. My actions throughout the years prove this trait I have. I began my law career in the office of the district attorney 
                of Alameda County and specialized in child assault cases where I fought for their rights, bringing justice and long-term benefits to 
                these kids. I decided to join politics, because I wanted to be able to fight for all citizen’s rights. In 2004, when I was elected 
                District Attorney of San Francisco, I was a national leader in the movement for LGBTQ+ rights, bringing long-term change for a future 
                of equality. In 2010, I was elected Attorney General of California where I oversaw the largest state justice department in the country, 
                defending the Affordable Care Act and enforcing environmental laws, bringing long-term success for the protection of our homes. In 2017, 
                I was elected to the US Senate where I helped create and pass many bipartisan legislations. And in 2021, I was elected to the Vice President, 
                where I continue to bring about long-lasting change and fight for your rights.

            <h2>Beliefs I have</h2>
            <h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;Every woman in every state must have reproductive freedom and access to the health care they need. That is why I have fought 
                to lower health care costs and protect the ability of every woman to make her own decisions about her own body. Today, our 
                Administration is proposing the largest expansion of contraception coverage in more than a decade. This new proposed rule will 
                build on our Administration’s work to protect reproductive freedom by providing millions of women with more options for the 
                affordable contraception they need and deserve. I stand with the majority of Americans – Republicans and Democrats alike – who 
                support access to contraception and abortion. We will continue to call on Congress to pass federal legislation that restores 
                reproductive freedom nationwide.
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;After decades of offshoring, manufacturing is returning across America, from major cities to rural counties, creating good-paying 
                jobs, including union jobs and jobs for those without college degrees. As vice president, I have helped create more than 1.6 
                million manufacturing and construction jobs, and American workers are rebuilding roads and bridges using materials made in America. 
                With these investments, I will continue to help America build the industries of the future while creating high-quality union jobs in 
                the electric vehicle and battery supply chains. I will also fight for unions, because I know that unions are the backbone of the middle 
                class. I will also fight to raise the minimum wage, end sub-minimum wages for tipped workers and people with disabilities, establish 
                paid family and medical leave, and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.

            <h2>Why SEIU supports Kamala Harris</h2>
            <h3>
                Supporting Harris aligns with our mission because she stands for the values we believe in: the dignity of work, access to health care, 
                and the right to fair pay. This ad is an effective way for us to reach voters directly, making sure they understand that voting for 
                Harris means supporting policies that protect workers and promote equality.
